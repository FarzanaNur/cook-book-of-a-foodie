                                For the momos, start by preparing the filling using finely chopped boneless chicken, ginger-garlic paste or powder, soy sauce, finely grated carrots (or any other vegetables of your choice), salt, and pepper. Mix everything well and set aside. For the dough, combine all-purpose flour with a pinch of salt, a little oil, and enough water to form a smooth dough, then let it rest for about 30 minutes. Roll out the dough into small circles, place a spoonful of the chicken and vegetable filling in the center, and fold the edges together to seal each momo. Steam the momos for 10-15 minutes until the dough is cooked through. For the sauce, mix chili flakes, tamarind, water, and oil, then heat it until well combined. Serve the momos hot with the prepared sauce.

                                To prepare delicious tuna kababs, start by combining drained canned tuna, grated carrot, mashed boiled potato, finely chopped onion, and green chilies in a mixing bowl. Season the mixture generously with salt and black pepper, ensuring all flavors are well blended. Add 2-3 tablespoons of rice flour or corn flour to bind the mixture, mixing thoroughly until it holds together firmly. Shape the mixture into evenly sized patties, then heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Shallow fry the kababs for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until they turn golden brown. Serve hot with your favorite chutney or ketchup for a flavorful snack.
